## Words per minute
This is a python program to give you your typing speed in words per minute.  
Make sure to have the `curses` python module in the environment and have the `texts.txt` in the same folder as the program when running it.  
> Run the program using command prompt or the terminal ONLY and change its address to the program's folder.  
> Run the terminal or command prompt in fullscreen to not bug the program!
